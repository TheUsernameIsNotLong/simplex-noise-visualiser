# simplex-noise-visualiser
A tool to visualise simplex noise in a command-line interface.

This is a seriously simple project, and merely came to fruition so I could learn simplex, rich, and shell scripting. Do not expect any future updates.

## Installation

You can configure your own virtual environment, but the guides below are designed to create them automatically and ensure you download the necessary dependencies.\
Currently, the automatic installers are in the form of launching `run.bat` and `run.sh` scripts. I may look into doing a single universal installer in the form of a python script soon.

    <summary>Windows Installation</summary>

1. Clone or [Download ZIP](https://github.com/TheUsernameIsNotLong/simplex-noise-visualiser/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. Launch `run.bat`. The program should create the virtual environment and install necessary dependencies for you on it's first launch.

1. Clone or [Download ZIP](https://github.com/TheUsernameIsNotLong/simplex-noise-visualiser/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. Run the command `chmod +x run.sh bin/setup.sh` in the project's root to make the run scripts executable.

3. Launch the program with `run.sh`. The program should create the virtual environment and install necessary dependencies for you on it's first launch.

I'm actually unsure whether this works on mac lol
